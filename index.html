                <h2 >Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    Sightless aliens with sharp hearing take over the planet and kill most of the human population. The Abbott family: mother Evelyn, father Lee, daughter Regan (who is deaf), and sons Marcus and Beau, lives on an isolated farm in the middle of the forest. They must take special precautions in order to avoid making noise, such as making sand paths through the forest to avoid stepping on crunching leaves, and using American Sign Language when communicating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the family goes into town for supplies, Beau finds a toy rocket, which his dad makes him put away because it would make too much noise. When they are getting ready to leave, Regan secretly gives him back the toy, but without its batteries. When they leave, Beau secretly takes back these batteries. While walking back home, Beau presses a button on the toy rocket, which starts making noise. The noise alerts a nearby creature who promptly jumps out of the forest and kills him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost a year after Beau's death, the family has seemingly gone back to normal, with Evelyn several months pregnant. Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with his dad while Regan, upset that she cannot go, visits Beau's grave. While everybody is gone, Evelyn goes into labor; while going downstairs, she steps on a nail, loudly dropping a picture frame she was holding. She flips a switch, turning the surrounding lights around the house red. She tries to go upstairs but finds out that one of the creatures entered the house after hearing the noise. Soon after, the alien enters the basement; Evelyn sets an egg timer, distracting the creature and giving herself time to run upstairs. She begins giving birth in the bathtub upstairs as the creature slowly makes its way towards her. Lee and Marcus, who are back from fishing, notice the red lights and set off fireworks to create a diversion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regan, seeing the fireworks, runs back to the house. Lee then enters the house and brings the baby and Evelyn into the basement. The baby cries, alerting a creature into the basement. This creature fails to find the source, but breaks some water pipes. Marcus and Regan go to the top of a silo and light a fire. Meanwhile, Evelyn wakes up in the flooded basement with the creature still inside; she hides behind a waterfront as this creature moves towards her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting into an argument, Marcus falls through the silo's roof, and Regan jumps after him. The creature in the basement runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus. Regan squeezes her cochlear implant, making a high pitched noise. The creature, in pain, runs off, breaking a hole in the silo. Lee finds Regan and Marcus, and tells them to get in his truck and drive back to the house. A creature then appears, attacks Lee, and wounds him; Marcus screams inside the truck, turning the creature's attention to them. Lee, realizing that his children will die, signs to Regan that he has always loved her, before screaming loudly. The creature then kills Lee, giving Regan and Marcus time to drive back to the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back at the house, the children are greeted by Evelyn and they embrace. After hearing a nearby creature shriek, they retreat to the basement, where Regan sees that her dad was studying cochlear implants to help her hear. A creature comes into the basement; Regan takes off her cochlear implant and slams it on a guitar amp, knocking the creature out. The creature gets up again shortly and tries to attack them, but Evelyn shoots it in the head, killing it. With Marcus and the baby hiding in the corner of the basement, Regan and Evelyn look on the screens connected to the security cameras and see two other creatures running towards the house; Evelyn looks at Regan, smiles, and cocks her shotgun.

                        <h4>Emily Blunt</h4>
                        <p>as Evelyn Abbott, wife of Lee, and the mother to their four children, Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott. Krasinski said her character wanted to ensure that their children "be fully-formed, fully-thinking people."</p>
                        <h4>John Krasinski</h4>
                        <p>as Lee Abbott, an engineer who is Evelyn's husband and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and newborn baby Abbott. Krasinski described his character as a survivalist focused on getting his family through each day.</p>
                        <h4>Milicent Simmonds</h4>
                        <p>as Regan Abbott, Lee and Evelyn's teenage deaf daughter, and Marcus' and Beau's older sister. Krasinski said he sought a deaf actress "...for many reasons; I didn't want a non-deaf actress pretending to be deaf ... a deaf actress would help my knowledge and my understanding of the situations tenfold. I wanted someone who lives it and who could teach me about it on set."</p>
                        <h4>Noah Jupe</h4>
                        <p> as Marcus Abbott, the second child and eldest son of Lee and Evelyn, and Regan's and Beau's brother. Krasinski noticed Jupe in the 2016 miniseries The Night Manager and watched an early screening of the 2017 film Suburbicon to evaluate Jupe's performance.</p>
                        <h4>Cade Woodward</h4>
                        <p>as Beau Abbott, Lee and Evelyn's four-year-old son. Beau is killed after he activates a battery-operated toy that attracts a creature.</p>
